# [KASM](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-kasm)

Kasm Workspaces is a docker container streaming platform for delivering browser-based access to desktops, applications, and web services. 

## Setup

Open `kasm-install.{{DOMAIN}}` in your browser and follow the setup wizard. The setup wizard is very buggy. I recommend to select only one image for the initial install to get a smoth install experience. When selection multiple image the install wizard sometimes crashes. Eg.g select the `arch xfce` image. The setup could take several minutes until `kasm.{{DOMAIN}}` is available!

## WebUI

Defautl admin user is `admin@kasm.local`.
