# [Jellyplist](https://github.com/kamilkosek/jellyplist)

Jellyplist is a companion app for Jellyfin that provide the option to replicate/sync playlists from Spotify to your local Jellyfin account. Under the hood, it uses SpotDL for downloading the corresponding tracks from the available sources if a track isnÂ´t found in your local library.

## TOOD

- Cool app but it is broken since March 2025. Wait for https://github.com/kamilkosek/jellyplist/issues/80 to get fixed.
